[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/i2000s/i2000s.github.io.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/i2000s/i2000s.github.io)

This site is mostly static HTML, generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
from [source on Github](https://github.com/i2000s/i2000s.github.io).  You are free
to fork and modify it for your own needs.
It was originally based on Carl Boettiger's
[labnotebook sites](http://carlboettiger.info) and David Ketcheson's [customization](http://davidketcheson.info).
Carl publishes the source for his site on Github as the
[labnotebook project](http://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook) and
releases it all under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),
so setting my site up was as easy as following
[his instructions](http://www.carlboettiger.info/README.html),
replacing the \_posts directory, and making a few CSS customizations.

To run the site on a local computer, you need to install Jekyll and
dependencies, run `bundle install` then `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

The [Publications page](publications.html) is generated from a bibtex file
using some [code David Ketcheson wrote to generate HTML divs from Bibtex](https://github.com/ketch/tex2_rst_html).
It also makes use of [jQuery](https://github.com/ketch/tex2_rst_html) and
[MixItUp](https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/) for filtering and searching.

Please report any errors or other feedback in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/i2000s/i2000s.github.io/issues).

Instruction on hosting the site locally
=======================================
I use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS OS to generate the static website from source code.
Instructions on other operating systems should be similar.

If you run Jekyll sites for the first time, you may need to install Ruby v2.2.* (tested on v2.2.4) and the `gem` development envirenment.
I was basically following [this instruction](http://tecadmin.net/install-ruby-on-rails-on-ubuntu/) on my Ubuntu,
except for the step of sourcing RVM which I used the following command line instead  
```
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
```
If the source is setup correctly, `type rvm | head -n 1` should give `rvm is a function` as the output according to [this](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).
For other systems, [here](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) is the official guide for Ruby installation.

Besides, the library of `gsl` and the `pandoc` package are recommended to install for better support to the `clarifier-reborn` and other plugins/scripts used in this site.
On Ubuntu, I use the following lines
```
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:marutter/c2d4u
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pandoc
sudo apt-get install gsl-bin libgsl0-dev
```
Otherwise, the `.travis.yml` configuration file should have some basic settings to follow.

The `Gemfile` and the configuration file `_conf.yml` should include sufficient information on installing correct dependences.
Then for a routinely rendering, you only need to run the following command lines:
```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Notice that, I have locked the Jekyll version to `~>2.5.3`.
If you want to use Jekyll version 3.0.0 or above, you may need to tweak the code a little bit.

Authorships of posts before Feb 10th, 2016
=========================================
Since this site was basically built on top of [David Ketcheson](http://davidketcheson.info) and [Carl Boettiger](http://carlboettiger.info)'s Labnotebook sites following the permitted Creative Commons license, please be advised that blog posts time-stamped before Feb 10th of 2016 may be written by David Ketcheson or Carl Boettiger.
I found most of them are good materials for open science, and hence didn't remove all of them while adapting the source code for my current website.
The authorships on those posts will be disclaimed more clearly by explicit statements and links to the origination on those posts--once I got a chance.
