[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/i2000s/i2000s.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/i2000s/i2000s.github.io)

This site is mostly static HTML, generated by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
from [source on Github](https://github.com/i2000s/i2000s.github.io).  You are free
to fork and modify it for your own needs.
It was originally based on Carl Boettiger's
[labnotebook sites](http://carlboettiger.info) and David Ketcheson's [customization](http://davidketcheson.info).
Carl publishes the source for his site on Github as the
[labnotebook project](http://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook) and
releases it all under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/),
so setting my site up was as easy as following
[his instructions](http://www.carlboettiger.info/README.html),
replacing the \_posts directory, and making a few CSS customizations.

To run the site on a local computer, you need to install Jekyll and
dependencies, run `bundle install` then `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

The [Publications page](publications.html) is generated from a bibtex file
using some [code David Ketcheson wrote to generate HTML divs from Bibtex](https://github.com/ketch/tex2_rst_html).
It also makes use of [jQuery](https://github.com/ketch/tex2_rst_html) and
[MixItUp](https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com/) for filtering and searching.

Please report any errors or other feedback in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ketch/labnotebook/issues).

Authorships of posts before Feb 10th, 2016
=========================================
Please be advised that blog posts time-stamped before Feb 10th of 2016 were written by [David Ketcheson](http://davidketcheson.info).
I found they are good materials for open science, and didn't remove all of them while adapting the source code of the notebook site for my current website.
The authorships on those posts will be disclaimed more clearly by explicit statements on those posts once I got a chance.
