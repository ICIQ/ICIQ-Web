This is a list of some of the tools that I use on a regular basis that have
come to be an essential part of my workflow.

## Writing papers

I use **LaTeX** for typesetting, and [TexStudio](http://texstudio.org/)
for typing.
References are managed using **Bibtex**.  I also use
[JabRef](http://jabref.org/), which is a simple GUI frontend for
Bibtex files.
Ideas with references are organized using [Docear](http://docear.org).

Most papers are kept in private repositories on
[CQuIC@GitHub](http://cquic-github.github.io) and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org).  My coauthors and I use **Git** to
allow us to work remotely on a paper and merge our changes.
If a coauthor is not comfortable with Git, papers are kept on **Dropbox**.

## Reading papers
I keep abreast of the literature using [Inoreader]() (an RSS feed reader) with
subscriptions to about a dozen arXiv and journal feeds.  I have a few alerts
set up on [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.com), which I also use for
finding specific papers.  See the post on
[Searching the Scientific Literature](http://www.davidketcheson.info/2011/10/27/searching-scientific-literature.html).


## Presentations
Lately, I write most presentations in **Powerpoint**.  I use
[texpoint](http://texpoint.necula.org/) to typeset equations onto slides.  
For drawn diagrams and graphics, I use [Omnigraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)
and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/).


## Code
Most of my coding is done with Matlab or Vim in Python or Julia.  I also use the following:

 1. IPython and IJulia.  For interactive running and debugging.
 1. The Jupyter notebook (formerly IPython notebook).  For organizing, recording, and
    sharing code with animations and mathematics.
 1. [Github](http://github.com) and [BitBucket](http://bitbucket.com).  For collaborative code development.

## Plotting

[Matlab](http://matlab.com), [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [VisClaw](https://github.com/clawpack/visclaw).

## Notes and productivity

 1. [OneNote](https://www.onenote.com/) from MicroSoft.
 1. [NValt](http://brettterpstra.com/nvalt-2-2-public-beta/).  For managing
    plain-text notes.
 1. [Omnifocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/).  For managing all the non-research stuff I do.
 1. [Gitit](http://gitit.net/).  Wiki software could be useful for
    internal collaboration within a group.

## Websites

 1. [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).  For building this website and a few others on GitHub.
 2. [Coda](https://panic.com/coda/).  
 3. [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/). For the [CQuIC website](http://cquic.unm.edu) I participated to build.
