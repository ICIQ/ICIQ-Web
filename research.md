## Current project

My research involves
theoretical studies on the strong coupling between atoms and photons on some nanofiber and nanophotonic platforms.
My current focus is the dispersive response theory of cold atoms trapped in the strong evanescent field of an optical nanofiber. 
This includes applications on quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement with dramatical improvements compared to the free-space platform that has been widely studied for atomic clocks and quantum information protocols.
My study has also been naturally extended to the implementation of atomic cooling and state preparation protocols based on optical pumping procedures on the nanofiber platform, which is challenging due to the complicated nature of the field components of fiber modes compared to the well-studied free-space cases.

 - QND measurement based on birefringence and Faraday interactions.
 - Optical pumping for state preparation and atomic cooling.

In addition, through establishing the theoretical fundation of light-atom interaction on the nanofiber platform, I hope to reach the regime of nonlinear interaction between photons and its application to quantum simulations/computations due to the strong light-atom coupling effects, 
and to deeply understand the quantum behaviors of atoms and photons and the role of nanophotonic geometries for quantum information applications.  Stay tuned!

## Short course: HyperPython

This is a 1-day course (designed to take about 7 hours) introducing the
basics of hyperbolic PDE theory and numerical discretization, and leading
up to the PyClaw package for solving advanced hyperbolic systems.  Traffic
flow and fluid dynamics are used as the primary examples.

## Short course: Teaching Numerics with Notebooks

These notebooks were prepared by myself and [Aron Ahmadia](http://aron.ahamadia.net)
for a tutorial we gave at SciPy 2014.  They're aimed at university professors
and others who wish to teach numerical methods with Python.

### About this page

*In 2011, I began keeping my teaching materials under version control.
In 2013, I began posting them in a public repository on Github, simply as a way
of backing them up.  In 2014, I started receiving occasional pull requests and
comments on those materials.  After
[Greg Wilson's inspiring talk at SciPy 2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e26rp6qPbA)
I decided I should make a bigger effort to enable others to reuse and
contribute to these materials.*
