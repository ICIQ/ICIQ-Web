As before, we will have a summer study topics for this year:
[Advanced Topics in Quantum Optics II](http://i2000s.github.io/2016/05/26/2016-summer-study-on-quantum-optics-II.html).

* Proposed main topics:
    * Optical pumping
    * Laser cooling
    * matrix/tensor product state representation of many-body systems (letâ€™s see if time permits)

The time is from June 1st to July 29th (flexible).

If you are interested to participate, comment below [Xiaodong Qi's post](http://i2000s.github.io/2016/05/26/2016-summer-study-on-quantum-optics-II.html) or post your academic question on our [Quantum Optics forum](https://disqus.com/home/channel/quantumoptics).

Have a fruitful summer of 2016!
