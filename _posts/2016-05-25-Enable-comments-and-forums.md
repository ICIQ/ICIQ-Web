Now you can add comments and discuss sophisticated questions on our topical forums on this site!

This has been made possible by reprogramming the site with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and integrating with [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) functionalities.
Comments are enabled on some pages, like this one (see bottom).
We have also created a couple of initial forums. Here they are:

- [Quantum Information and Computing](https://disqus.com/home/channel/quantuminformationandcomputing).

- [Quantum Optics](https://disqus.com/home/channel/quantumoptics) -- this will be used for the coming summer group study.

In the future, you should be able to add new forums to this site by simply adding the Disqus forum name to the configuration file (\_config.yml) of the source code.
To add a forum or participate discussions using the two functions, you may be asked by the plugin to create/login the Disqus account using your email/social media accounts.

Hopefully this helps! And, yeah, comment below if you have questions or suggestions.
