As before, we will have a [summer study plan for this year(http://i2000s.github.io/en/2017/05/20/2017-summer-study.html).

* Proposed main topics:
    * Chaos, randomness and scrambling.
    * Basic skills for scientific programming ([CQuIC computing workshop](https://cquic.github.io/summer17-computing-workshop/)).

The time is from May 19th to Aug 9th (flexible).

If you are interested to participate, comment below [Xiaodong Qi's post](http://i2000s.github.io/en/2017/05/20/2017-summer-study.html) or post your peer reviews onto our [followup projects](https://cquic.github.io/summer17-computing-workshop/resources/followup-projects.html).
Unfortunately, our telecom ports are all booked, and hence remote connections seems impossible this year.

Have a fruitful summer of 2017!
